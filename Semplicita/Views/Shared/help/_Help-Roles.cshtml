            Roles are what define a user's level of authority over other users, and can grant/limit access to certain components or abilities. <br />
            Here they are listed in order of precedence:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Server Administrator:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allows full access to all user, project, ticket data, ticket types, statuses, and workflows.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Project Administrator:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allowed to create new projects, or deactivate active projects.</li>
                        <li>Allowed to manipulate user allocations, project settings, &amp; ticket data of projects to which they are assigned to by a Server Administrator.</li>
                        <li>Not allowed to manipulate ticket types, ticket statuses, or workflows.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Super Solver:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Similar to a Solver, Super Solvers are also responsible for resolving tickets.</li>
                        <li>They have the ability to work within <u><i>any</i></u> ticket in projects to which they are assigned.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, they have the ability to re-assign tickets to other solvers regardless of who the ticket is originally assigned to.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Solver:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Solvers are responsible for resolving tickets that they are assigned.</li>
                        <li>Solvers are allowed to view dashboard data about personal performance, but can only work within tickets they are assigned.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
